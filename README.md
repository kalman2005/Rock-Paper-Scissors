# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Just your basic Rock, Paper, Scissors. The only difference is the addition of health (which isn't very original to be frank), and a way to punish people who just use one move. 

I used python3, and I am not completely sure if it works on other versions of python.
If you have any questions you can ask them to me.
